#### **Need help with your submission? Check out the tips below**

* Download the <a href="/files/child_taxonomy%20tagging%20playbook_wef%20fy23.pdf" download="">Taxonomy Tagging Playbook</a> to help with your project categorisation. 
* Do write clearly and concisely. Use words or terms that are easily understandable by all professions.
* There is no word limit. However, we encourage short and simple write-ups (ideally not more than **1,500 words**) for ease of reading and understanding. 
* In the spirit of co-learning and knowledge sharing, we encourage you to share insights and tips on both your successes and challenges to help others who may be interested to embark on a similar project under **Lessons Learnt**.
* Select the appropriate **project category** will allow your project to be classified and featured in the relevant categories on CHILD, including: *Applied/ Translational Research, Care Continuum, Care &amp; Process Redesign, Organisational Leadership, Training &amp; Education, Technology and Workforce Transformation*.
* Enter the appropriate **keywords** relevant to your project will make it more searchable and visible to other CHILD users. 
* Tips on choosing keywords: 
	* Think like a reader when creating your keywords; Think about terms you would use to search about the topic of your project
	* Try to focus on the ‘theme’ of your write-up and sum it up in 1 to 3 words. Keywords should be closely related to the topic and suggests what the topic is about 
	* Keywords should indicate the specificity of the project and should not be too broad
	* Don’t have to include prepositions or articles such as “of”, “a” and “the”.
* You may want to proofread your submission with someone who has no knowledge about your project. This can help ensure that your write-up is easily understandable by other professions.

Enjoy the process!
