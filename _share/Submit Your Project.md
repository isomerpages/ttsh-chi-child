* Tips on choosing keywords:

	* Try to focus on the ‘theme’ of your write-up and sum it up in 1 to 3 words. Keywords should be closely related to the topic and suggests what the topic is about 
	* Keywords should indicate the specificity of the project and should not be too broad
	* Don’t have to include prepositions or articles such as “of”, “a” and “the”.
* You may want to proofread your submission with someone who has no knowledge about your project. This can help ensure that your write-up is easily understandable by other professions.
