In conjunction with AI Appreciation Day 2024 recently, CHILD is proud to highlight three exemplary projects this month that showcase the transformative power of AI in healthcare.&nbsp;&nbsp;

These projects, drawn from public healthcare clusters across Singapore, not only exemplify the versatility and impact of AI in healthcare but also demonstrate how AI-driven innovation can enhance patient outcomes, streamline workflows, and empower healthcare professionals to focus on delivering exceptional care:

1. Through the use of explainable AI models, this inter-disciplinary team from <a rel="noopene" target="blank" href="https://for.sg/child-chi-sg-child-collection-wh-ttsh-aitis-ntu-shbc2023-584">Woodlands Health (WH), Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), AITI Solutions and Nanyang Technological University (NTU)</a> developed an application for cost-effective and efficient **analysis of wound images** from an Asian cohort to support clinical decisions with 83% accuracy and 60% explainability. *\[Silver Awardee of Best Poster Award (Clinical Research) at Singapore Health &amp; Biomedical Congress 2023\]*

2.

3.  By developing an efficient AI-based triage framework, this project by <a rel="noopene" target="blank" href="https://for.sg/child-chi-sg-child-collection-shrc-shr-shmc2023-896">Health Services Research Centre and SingHealth Research</a> enabled health workers in low resource settings to **triage patients more effectively for head and neck cancers** with more than 80% accuracy. *\[Merit Prize Awardee (Operations category) at Singapore Healthcare Management (SHM) Congress 2023\]*
