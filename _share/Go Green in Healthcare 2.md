1. By piloting the matchmaking of donated unused medications with suitable patients who are willing to use them, <b>'PRIME_MedMatch:  Project to Reduce the Impact of Medication wastage on Environment in Community Care (PRIME) - Matching Donors with Recipients to Reduce Medication wastage (MedMatch)'</b> aims to reduce carbon footprint from pharmaceuticals, promote health equity and access to healthcare, as well as reduce healthcare costs for those in need. Led by a multidisciplinary tripartite team from <a rel="noopene" target="blank" href="https://for.sg/chi-sg-knowledge-hub-ntfgh-nhip2022-270"> Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), National University Hospital (NUH) &amp; KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH)</a>, this project had achieved 5 successful matches and over $3000 in cost savings from donated medications during their pilot study.
